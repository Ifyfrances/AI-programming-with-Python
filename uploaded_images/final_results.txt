PROJECT FINAL RESULTS
** Statistics from calculates_results_stats() function:
N Images: 40  N Dog Images: 30  N NotDog Images: 10 
Pct Corr dog:   0.0 Pct Corr NOTdog:   0.0  Pct Corr Breed:  93.3

** Check Statistics - calculated from this function as a check:
N Images: 40  N Dog Images: 30  N NotDog Images: 10 
Pct Corr dog: 100.0 Pct Corr NOTdog: 100.0  Pct Corr Breed:  93.3

*** Results Summary for CNN Model Architecture VGG ***
N Images            :  40
N Dog Images        :  30
N Not-Dog Images    :  10

***After runnung run_models_batch.sh
From my program, 
 - VGG was able to classify the dogs 100% and not a dog 100%
 - AlexNet was able to classify not dogs 100%, but dogs 50%. It was ble to detect the image was a dog but didn't classify the breed correctly
 - ResNet was able to classify not dogs 100% and dogs 50%. It was able to identify Dog_01 as a dog
and classified the breed corectly. But failed to identify Dog_02 as a dog.

CONCLUSION

Compared to the final results of the project, the best model architecture is VGG. 
It out performed both of the other architectures when considering both objectives of the project
Also, it is the best model because it was able to classify "dogs" and "not-a-dog" with 100% accuracy and had the best performance 
regarding breed classification with 100% accuracy.
